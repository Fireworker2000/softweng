# "softweng" - my project for Advanced Software Engineering

Second attempt at this. Changed topic in between.

The folder "Altes Projekt" contains the old project which wasn't even started due to procrastination. So you'll see no code, only a collection of my ideas written in gibberish German.

For the actual project, please head over to "PIC16F84 Simulator". You'll find anything important over there. To run it, just run the SimGui class.

## Funfact

The mountain we call Mount Vesuvius didn't exist when Pompeii got destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 A.D.
The peak that's now called Vesuvius rose from the caldera of the much larger volcano Mount Somma during/after the eruption that destroyed Pompeii.
